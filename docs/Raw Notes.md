## Basics

You and your friends will take on World Three with your Net Navis

_How will battle chips work in this game?_

- Each player will recieve a starting deck matching their Net Navi.
- Each player will start a Net Battle with a hand of six cards

- Use NetNavi Ability
- Move panels (6 x 5 board)
Enemy Take turn in between player turns
- One of the enemies uses a card from the enemy deck
- If a boss, use a card from the boss deck
  - Use a die to make it interesting

What happens when you beat an enemy?
- Get a reward card (Enemy Skill)
- Get a boss chip* whoever lands the killing blow gets the boss chip

Where do we want to pull our Battle Chips from?
- I would venture we should pull the stylings/updates from MMBN6, so that if we add more Navis or Cross Changes and what not, we can be ready to go
